      completely burnt from the wildfires, I want to extend my hand to you and
      support you as much as I can. While rebuilding my own personal loss, I&#39;ve
      brought my team together to be here as a help and guide to work with you
      and build a new home. With 20 years of architectural experience I&#39;m
      expecting to go through some obstacles given the size of this disaster. We
      will need to go through a learning process as we work with the authorities
      and help them to accommodate us; however, if we take this on as a
      community, we&#39;ll be able to overcome these obstacles more accurately and
      promptly.</p>
