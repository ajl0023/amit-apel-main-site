        studio focused on bespoke architectural creations. Specializing in new
        development, private residences, specialty concepts, and hospitality
        projects, we have worked extensively across Europe, Asia, South America,
        and the US. Led by Amit Apel and Michael B. MacLaren (AIA), our diverse
        team is composed of some of the top design professionals in the country
        with wide experiences in institutional practice, commercial and
        residential work. Each project starts with a thoughtfully conceived
        design that complements the surrounding environment while challenging
        the boundaries of traditional architecture to create detailed spaces
        that are both functional and perennial. At the very core of every
        concept is one central experience: connecting people to the art of
        living.</p></div></div>`,l(e,"class","container svelte-hh65om")},m(t,n){p(t,e,n)},p:a,i:a,o:a,d(t){t&&h(e)}}}function f(i,e,t){let n;return v(i,m,o=>t(0,n=o)),u(()=>{n()}),[]}class w extends s{constructor(e){super();r(this,e,f,y,c,{})}}export{w as default};
