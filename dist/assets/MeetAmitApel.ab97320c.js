        arrived on the sunny shores of Southern California in 1999 after having
        been raised in Africa, Israel and throughout Europe. Upon his arrival,
        Amit purchased a modest Honda Magnum motorcycle to travel across the USA
        for three months. After his adventurous, cross-country tour and with
        little means, he opened a humble, 100 sq. ft. art studio within a
        locksmith shop on the beaches of Malibu, California and instantly became
        a local, buzz-worthy artist. Amit\u2019s acrylic and oil paintings that were
        showcased in this very small shop quickly catapulted into high demand by
        local, celebrity clients who still treasure his paintings and collect
        his growing body of art design works ranging from paintings, sculptures,
        jewelry, apparel and home and outdoor d\xE9cor and furnishings. With his
        savvy entrepreneurial determination inspired by his passionate drive to
        design and produce as a way of life, Amit founded Amit Apel Design,
        Inc.\xAE in 2000. This boutique, custom design firm now based in Malibu,
        California has a well-established, stellar reputation that has been
        built over the years on a vast array of award-winning commercial and
        residential and interior designs that now span across Europe, Asia,
        South America as well as across the US.</p>`,l(o,"class","main-image-container flex-item svelte-nrlfbq"),l(c,"class",m="flex-item content-image-container glitch-image-container "+(r[0]?"glitch-container":"")+" svelte-nrlfbq"),l(a,"class","glitch-image-wrapper svelte-nrlfbq"),l(p,"class","flex-item main-text-content svelte-nrlfbq"),l(e,"class","content-container svelte-nrlfbq"),l(t,"class","container svelte-nrlfbq")},m(i,g){q(i,t,g),d(t,e),d(e,a),d(a,o),d(a,u),d(a,c);for(let n=0;n<s.length;n+=1)s[n].m(c,null);d(e,y),d(e,p),v||(A=[M(a,"mouseenter",r[1]),M(a,"mouseleave",r[2])],v=!0)},p(i,[g]){if(g&0){f=Array(5).fill("");let n;for(n=0;n<f.length;n+=1){const w=S(i,f,n);s[n]?s[n].p(w,g):(s[n]=k(w),s[n].c(),s[n].m(c,null))}for(;n<s.length;n+=1)s[n].d(1);s.length=f.length}g&1&&m!==(m="flex-item content-image-container glitch-image-container "+(i[0]?"glitch-container":"")+" svelte-nrlfbq")&&l(c,"class",m)},i:_,o:_,d(i){i&&x(t),H(s,i),v=!1,U(A)}}}function D(r,t,e){let a;z(r,I,m=>e(3,a=m));let o=!1;return L(()=>{a()}),[o,()=>{e(0,o=!0),setTimeout(()=>{e(0,o=!1)},400)},()=>{e(0,o=!1)}]}class K extends C{constructor(t){super();j(this,t,D,B,T,{})}}export{K as default};
